  Diff::LCS computes the difference between two Enumerable sequences using the
  McIlroy-Hunt longest common subsequence (LCS) algorithm. It includes utilities
  to create a simple HTML diff output format and a standard diff-like tool.

  This is release 1.2.4, fixing a bug introduced after diff-lcs 1.1.3 that did
  not properly prune common sequences at the beginning of a comparison set.
  Thanks to Paul Kunysch for fixing this issue.

  Coincident with the release of diff-lcs 1.2.3, we reported an issue with
  Rubinius in 1.9 mode
  ({rubinius/rubinius#2268}[https://github.com/rubinius/rubinius/issues/2268]).
  We are happy to report that this issue has been resolved.
